### Introduction

This repository contains my projects for [Code for Sacramento](https://codeforsacramento.org/) with focus on data science and spatial analysis.

Code for Sacramento is a [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) brigade which volunteers its time to develop projects for non-profits and local municipalities using open-source technologies.

### Projects

1. 2019 NSF Civic Innovation Challenge - GIS web application developed to evaluate flood and erosion risk due to climate change in the Sacramento Area. Application was built using the ESRI JS API and Node.JS framework.
2. Computer Vision Modeling for Litter Detection - Trained models for custom object detection with [Microsoft Custom Vision](https://customvision.ai) to detect and evaluate trash levels on roads and highways.
3. City of Sacramento Service Call Analysis - Analysis for the neighborhood portal project with statistical and spatial analysis.

### Methodology

Appropriate technologies, tools and analytical methods are selected for each project. Results are documented within README and notebook documentation.

### Installation and Citations

Each project has specific installation instructions and citations within the RREADME document.
