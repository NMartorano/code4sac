### Introduction

This repository contains my projects for [Code for Sacramento](https://codeforsacramento.org/) with focus on data science and spatial analysis.

Code for Sacramento is a [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) brigade which volunteers its time to develop projects for non-profits and local municipalities using open-source technologies.

### Projects

1.

### Methodology
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model fits showed that spatial and temporal analysis would be more appropriate methods of analysis.
2. As a result, spatial analysis with R and GeoDa were used to identify trends.
3. Findings are documented within the notebook; additional analysis was completed in GeoDa.

### Installation
1. Notebook is written in R markdown, so be sure that R Studio is installed then clone this repository.
2. Load notebook in R Studio, run/download dependencies.
3. For spatial analysis, download and start the GeoDa [spatial analysis tool](https://geodacenter.github.io/download.html) which was developed by the University of Chicago [Spatial Data Science Program](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/).
